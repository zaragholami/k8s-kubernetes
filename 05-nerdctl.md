#### âœ… What is nerdctl?
nerdctl is a Docker-compatible CLI for containerd â€” a container runtime used by Kubernetes and lightweight distributions like k3s. It lets you manage containers, images, and networks â€” just like Docker â€” but using containerd directly
Itâ€™s commonly used when working with:
k3s clusters
Minimal, secure environments where Docker is not installed
`containerd` as the runtime

#### âœ… Installation
```
# Go to /usr/local/bin or another directory in your $PATH
cd /usr/local/bin

# Download the latest nerdctl release (adjust version if needed)
wget https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl/releases/download/v1.7.5/nerdctl-full-1.7.5-linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Extract the archive
tar zxvf nerdctl-full-1.7.5-linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Move nerdctl to /usr/local/bin if not already there
cp nerdctl /usr/local/bin/

# Optional: verify
nerdctl --version
```

#### Basic and Important nerdctl Commands

-n k8s.io option in nerdctl refers to the containerd namespace that Kubernetes uses to manage its containers.

List all Kubernetes containers:
```
nerdctl -n k8s.io ps -a
```
Exec into a running Kubernetes container:
```
nerdctl -n k8s.io exec -it <container-id> sh
```
View images used by Kubernetes:
```
nerdctl -n k8s.io images
```
**containerd Environment Variables**

`CONTAINERD_ADDRESS` tells your tools where to find the containerd socket file to connect with the containerd service.

`CONTAINERD_NAMESPACE` sets the namespace containerd uses, usually `k8s.io` for Kubernetes workloads

You can add these to your `.bashrc` file to avoid typing `-n k8s.io` every time: 
```
echo 'export CONTAINERD_ADDRESS=/run/containerd/containerd.sock' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export CONTAINERD_NAMESPACE=k8s.io' >> ~/.bashrc
```
Then reload your shell:
```
bash -l
```
After this, you can use `nerdctl` commands without the `-n k8s.io` option, for example:
```
nerdctl ps -a
nerdctl exec -it <container-id> sh
nerdctl images
```
