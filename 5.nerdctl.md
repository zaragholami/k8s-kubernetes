#### âœ… What is nerdctl?
nerdctl is a Docker-compatible CLI for containerd â€” a container runtime used by Kubernetes and lightweight distributions like k3s. It lets you manage containers, images, and networks â€” just like Docker â€” but using containerd directly
Itâ€™s commonly used when working with:
k3s clusters
Minimal, secure environments where Docker is not installed
`containerd` as the runtime
#### Basic and Important nerdctl Commands
Show running containers
```
nerdctl ps
```
Show all containers (including stopped)
```
nerdctl ps -a
```
Run a container
```
nerdctl run -it --name test-container alpine sh
```
`-it`: interactive terminal

`--name`: name your container

`alpine`: lightweight image

`sh`: start a shell

Pull an image
