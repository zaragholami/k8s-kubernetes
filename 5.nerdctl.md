#### ✅ What is nerdctl?
nerdctl is a Docker-compatible CLI for containerd — a container runtime used by Kubernetes and lightweight distributions like k3s. It lets you manage containers, images, and networks — just like Docker — but using containerd directly
It’s commonly used when working with:
k3s clusters
Minimal, secure environments where Docker is not installed
`containerd` as the runtime
